### [OPTIMIZER] Large File Refactoring - Split types.ts into Domain-Specific Modules (Issue #1293) ✅
- **Mode**: OPTIMIZER
- **Issue**: #1293
- **Priority**: P2 (High Priority - Technical Debt)
- **Status**: Completed
- **Started**: 2026-01-31
- **Completed**: 2026-01-31
- **Reason**: types.ts (1808 lines) is too large and violates Pillar 11 (Modularity). Splitting into domain-specific files improves maintainability, reduces build times, and follows clean architecture principles.
- **Files Created**:
  1. ✅ src/types/common.ts (27 lines) - Common types (Sender, ChatMessage, FeaturedProgram, LatestNews, UserRole, UserExtraRole)
  2. ✅ src/types/users.ts (126 lines) - User-related types (Student, Teacher, Parent, ParentChild, StudentParent, ParentTeacher, ParentMeeting, ParentMessage, ParentPayment, User)
  3. ✅ src/types/academic.ts (165 lines) - Academic types (Subject, Class, Schedule, Grade, Assignment, AssignmentType, AssignmentStatus, etc.)
  4. ✅ src/types/ppdb.ts (86 lines) - PPDB types (PPDBRegistrant, PPDBPipelineStatus, DocumentPreview, etc.)
  5. ✅ src/types/inventory.ts (85 lines) - Inventory types (InventoryItem, MaintenanceSchedule, InventoryAudit, etc.)
  6. ✅ src/types/events.ts (96 lines) - Event types (SchoolEvent, EventRegistration, EventBudget, EventPhoto, EventFeedback)
  7. ✅ src/types/materials.ts (269 lines) - Material/Library types (ELibrary, MaterialFolder, OCR-related types, etc.)
  8. ✅ src/types/announcements.ts (52 lines) - Announcement types (AnnouncementCategory, AnnouncementTargetType, Announcement, AnnouncementFormData)
  9. ✅ src/types/voice.ts (208 lines) - Voice-related types (VoiceLanguage, SpeechRecognition, SpeechSynthesis)
  10. ✅ src/types/notifications.ts (161 lines) - Notification types (NotificationSettings, PushNotification, VoiceNotification, etc.)
  11. ✅ src/types/chat.ts (98 lines) - Messaging types (DirectMessage, Conversation, Participant, ConversationFilter, etc.)
  12. ✅ src/types/messaging.ts (91 lines) - Communication log types (CommunicationLogEntry, CommunicationLogFilter, CommunicationLogStats)
  13. ✅ src/types/analytics.ts (120 lines) - Analytics types (GradeDistribution, SubjectAnalytics, StudentPerformance, etc.)
  14. ✅ src/types/study.ts (110 lines) - Study plan types (StudyPlan, StudyPlanSubject, StudyPlanSchedule, etc.)
  15. ✅ src/types/quiz.ts (95 lines) - Quiz types (Quiz, QuizQuestion, QuizAttempt, QuizAnalytics)
  16. ✅ src/types/index.ts (17 lines) - Re-exports all types for backward compatibility
- **Verification**:
  1. ✅ TypeScript type checking: Passed (0 errors)
  2. ✅ ESLint linting: Passed (0 errors, 0 warnings)
  3. ✅ All type definitions properly organized by domain
  4. ✅ Backward compatibility maintained via index.ts re-exports
- **Impact**: 
  - Improved code modularity (Pillar 11: Atomic, reusable components)
  - Enhanced maintainability - easier to locate and modify related types
  - Reduced build times by enabling better tree-shaking (Pillar 13: Performance)
  - Follows clean architecture principles (Pillar 2: Standardization)
  - Total types directory: 1,971 lines across 17 files (average 116 lines per file)
- **Notes**: Original 1808-line types.ts file has been successfully refactored into 17 domain-specific files. All imports from '../types' now resolve to the new modular structure via src/types/index.ts. Pre-existing files (email.types.ts, permissions.ts, recharts.d.ts) were preserved and integrated into the new structure.
