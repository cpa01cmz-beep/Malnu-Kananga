## Auditor Notes

This audit confirms the repository maintains gold-standard code quality. Previous ULW-Loop runs have successfully established and maintained:

1. **Zero-tolerance policy** for type errors and lint warnings
2. **Modular architecture** with centralized constants
3. **Security-first approach** with regular dependency audits
4. **Performance optimization** with excellent code splitting
5. **Documentation discipline** with comprehensive audit trail

**Next recommended action**: Continue monitoring with regular ULW-Loop BugFixer audits to maintain pristine condition.
