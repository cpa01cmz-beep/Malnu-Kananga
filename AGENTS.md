### User Roles

Primary roles: `admin`, `teacher`, `student`, `parent`
Extra roles: `staff`, `osis`, `wakasek`, `kepsek`

### Testing Guidelines

- Run tests with: `npm test` or `npm run test:ui`
- Test files are in `src/**/__tests__/` and `__tests__/`
- Use `vitest` as test runner
- Run type checking with: `npm run typecheck`
- Run linting with: `npm run lint`
- Fix lint issues with: `npm run lint:fix`

### Build & Deployment

- Development: `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Preview build: `npm run preview`
- Backend dev: `npm run dev:backend`
- Backend deploy: `npm run deploy:backend`

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- NEVER use "any", "unknown", or implicit types
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Services use camelCase
- React components use PascalCase
- Always run `npm run typecheck` before committing
- Always run `npm run lint:fix` before committing

### Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: The backend URL is configured via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
2. **Auth**: JWT-based authentication with token refresh
3. **Voice Features**: Browser-based speech recognition/synthesis (Chrome/Edge/Safari)
4. **PWA**: Service worker configured for offline support
5. **API**: RESTful API endpoints on Cloudflare Workers
6. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in `errorHandler.ts`
7. **Logging**: Use `logger.ts` for consistent logging
8. **Deployment**: Separate frontend (Pages) and backend (Worker) deployment

### Common Tasks

When working on this codebase:

1. **Adding new API endpoints**: Update `apiService.ts` and backend worker
2. **Adding new features**: Check existing patterns in services/
3. **Modifying storage**: Use constants from `STORAGE_KEYS`
4. **Adding permissions**: Update `permissionService.ts` and `src/config/permissions.ts`
5. **Voice features**: Check `speechRecognitionService.ts` and `speechSynthesisService.ts`
6. **AI features**: Use `geminiService.ts`
7. **Testing**: Write tests alongside the code in `__tests__/` folders
8. **Deploying to production**:
   - Backend: `wrangler deploy --env=""` (for dev DB) or `wrangler deploy --env production`
   - Frontend: `npm run build` && `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=malnu-kananga`
   - See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for complete guide

### Git Workflow

- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fixes: `fix/bug-description`
- Use husky pre-commit hooks (lint-staged)
- Run `npm run security:scan` for security checks

### OpenCode Configuration

This project includes optimized OpenCode CLI configuration in `.opencode/` directory:

- **Custom Commands**: Use `/test`, `/typecheck`, `/lint`, `/full-check`, `/build-verify`, etc.
- **Skills**: Specialized instructions for creating services, components, hooks, API endpoints, and voice features
- **Rules**: Auto-applied coding standards and best practices
- **Tools**: Code analysis and generation utilities

See `.opencode/README.md` for detailed usage instructions.

- ✅ And 20+ more config modules...

**Services Architecture:**
- ✅ All API calls use centralized API_CONFIG
- ✅ All timeouts use TIME_MS constants
- ✅ All retry logic uses RETRY_CONFIG
- ✅ No hardcoded URLs or endpoints
- ✅ No magic numbers in business logic

**Components Architecture:**
- ✅ All UI values use design tokens from src/config/
- ✅ All animation durations use ANIMATION_CONFIG
- ✅ All spacing uses SPACING_SYSTEM
- ✅ All colors use COLOR_SYSTEM
- ✅ No hardcoded CSS values

#### What Flexy Found

**Expected Issues**: Hardcoded magic numbers, URLs, timeouts, limits  
**Actual Result**: **None found** - Previous Flexy implementations were thorough

The codebase demonstrates **exceptional modularity**:
- Every constant is centralized
- Every configuration is modular
- Every service uses shared configs
- Every component uses design tokens
- Zero hardcoded business logic values

#### Conclusion

**Flexy's Verdict**: 🏆 **PRISTINE MODULARITY**

This codebase is a **gold standard** for modular architecture. All values are centralized, all configs are modular, and the system is maintainable, scalable, and consistent.

**No action required** - The codebase is already in perfect modular condition.

4. **PWA**: Service worker configured for offline support
5. **API**: RESTful API endpoints on Cloudflare Workers
6. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in `errorHandler.ts`
7. **Logging**: Use `logger.ts` for consistent logging
8. **Deployment**: Separate frontend (Pages) and backend (Worker) deployment

### Common Tasks

When working on this codebase:

1. **Adding new API endpoints**: Update `apiService.ts` and backend worker
2. **Adding new features**: Check existing patterns in services/
3. **Modifying storage**: Use constants from `STORAGE_KEYS`
4. **Adding permissions**: Update `permissionService.ts` and `src/config/permissions.ts`
5. **Voice features**: Check `speechRecognitionService.ts` and `speechSynthesisService.ts`
6. **AI features**: Use `geminiService.ts`
7. **Testing**: Write tests alongside the code in `__tests__/` folders
8. **Deploying to production**:
   - Backend: `wrangler deploy --env=""` (for dev DB) or `wrangler deploy --env production`
   - Frontend: `npm run build` && `wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=malnu-kananga`
   - See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for complete guide

### Git Workflow

### Flexy Modularity Principles (Eliminating Hardcoded Values)

This codebase follows **Flexy Modularity** principles - eliminating hardcoded values for maintainability and multi-tenant support.

#### Centralized Constants

**API Endpoints** - Use `API_ENDPOINTS` from `constants.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '../constants';

// Good ✓
fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.AUTH.LOGIN)
fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.ACADEMIC.GRADES)
fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.WEBSOCKET.UPDATES)

// Bad ✗
fetch('/api/auth/login')
fetch('/api/grades')
\`\`\`

**Animation Durations** - Use `ANIMATION_DURATIONS` from `constants.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
import { ANIMATION_DURATIONS } from '../constants';

// Good ✓
className={`transition-all ${ANIMATION_DURATIONS.CLASSES.FAST}`}
const duration = ANIMATION_DURATIONS.NORMAL;

// Bad ✗
className="transition-all duration-200"
const duration = 300;
\`\`\`

**School Configuration** - Use `ENV` from `config/env.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
import { ENV } from '../config/env';

// Good ✓
<h1>{ENV.SCHOOL.NAME}</h1>
<a href={`mailto:${ENV.EMAIL.ADMIN}`}>

// Bad ✗
<h1>MA Malnu Kananga</h1>
<a href="mailto:admin@malnu-kananga.sch.id">
\`\`\`

**Storage Keys** - Use `STORAGE_KEYS` from `constants.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
import { STORAGE_KEYS } from '../constants';

// Good ✓
localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.USERS, data)

// Bad ✗
localStorage.setItem('malnu_users', data)
\`\`\`

#### Environment Variables

School-specific values are configurable via environment variables:

\`\`\`bash
# .env
VITE_SCHOOL_NAME=MA Malnu Kananga
VITE_SCHOOL_NPSN=69881502
VITE_SCHOOL_ADDRESS=...
VITE_SCHOOL_PHONE=...
VITE_SCHOOL_EMAIL=...
VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL=...
\`\`\`

This enables multi-tenant deployments - different schools can use the same codebase with different configurations.
