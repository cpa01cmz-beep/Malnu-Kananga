    "body": "## Summary of Changes\n\nHello @cpa01cmz-beep, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request focuses on a significant cleanup and modernization of the project's frontend infrastructure. It removes outdated configuration files and bundled assets, updates the build system to a newer version of Vite, and enhances the main HTML file with comprehensive SEO and mobile optimization features. These changes aim to improve the project's maintainability, performance, and overall user experience by reducing technical debt and optimizing for modern web standards.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **File Cleanup and Repository Reorganization**: Removed numerous configuration files and directories, including `.idx/dev.nix` and all `.roo` rule files, streamlining the repository structure.\n* **Frontend Build System Update**: Upgraded Vite from version `5.3.1` to `7.2.2` and removed `rollup-plugin-visualizer` and `sharp` dependencies, indicating a significant update to the project's build tooling.\n* **HTML Meta Tag Enhancements**: Added extensive SEO-related meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter card meta tags to `dist/index.html` for improved search engine visibility and social media sharing.\n* **Mobile Optimization Styles**: Introduced new CSS rules in `dist/index.html` for mobile touch optimizations, including touch feedback, improved touch targets, passive event listeners, and prevention of input zoom on iOS.\n* **Bundled JavaScript File Removal**: Deleted several bundled JavaScript files and their source maps from the `dist/js` directory, likely a result of the Vite upgrade and build process changes.\n* **API Service Exports**: Modified `src/services/api/index.ts` to export new `FeaturedProgramsApiService` and `NewsApiService` services, enhancing the application's data fetching capabilities.\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Ignored Files</b></summary>\n\n*   **Ignored by pattern:** `.github/workflows/**` (1)\n    *   .github/workflows/iflow-cli.yml\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.
